  description: >-

    Some general notes about this end point:

    - This API describes how the Consumer has elected to pay for their account
    - Payments initiated by the Consumer are classified as manual payments. The billing frequency is captured for manual
      payments. The consumer may choose to pay on a different schedule/frequency. The payment method and frequency is
      not captured for manual payments
    - Payments that can be initiated by the energy retailer, based on Consumer preferences and permissions, include payments
      based on a direct debit, card debit or digital wallet setup. Each of these requires a payment frequency to be provided
      along with other relevant fields.
    - Information about payment plans related to debt repayments or arrangements due to hardship is not captured within this
      API
