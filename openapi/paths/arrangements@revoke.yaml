    Providers and Initiator Initiators MUST implement a CDR Arrangement Revocation End Point that can be used to revoke an existing sharing arrangement.

    This end point will be implemented according to the following:
    * Initiators and Providers MUST revoke consent by calling the CDR Arrangement Revocation End Point with a valid CDR Arrangement ID
    * Providers MUST publish their CDR Arrangement Revocation End Point  using their OpenID Provider Metadata Discovery End Point
    * Initiators MUST expose their CDR Arrangement Revocation End Point  under their `recipient_base_uri` published in their Software Statement Assertion
    * Consent revocation MUST also revoke associated refresh and/or access tokens
    * For Initiators, Provider must be authenticated when they call this end point according to the guidance in the Client Authentication section.
    * If the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` is not related to the client making the call it MUST be rejected
