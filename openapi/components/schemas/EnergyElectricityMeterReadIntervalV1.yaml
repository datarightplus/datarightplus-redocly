description: Mandatory if readUType is set to intervalRead
properties:
  readIntervalLength:
    description: Read interval length in minutes. Required when interval-reads
      query parameter equals FULL or MIN_30
    minimum: 1
    type: integer
    x-cds-type: PositiveInteger
    example: 15
  aggregateValue:
    description: The aggregate sum of the interval read values. If positive
      then it means net consumption, if negative it means net export
    type: number
    example: 150
  intervalReads:
    description: Array of Interval read values. If positive then it means consumption,
      if negative it means export. Required when interval-reads query parameter
      equals FULL or  MIN_30. Each read value indicates the read for the
      interval specified by readIntervalLength beginning at midnight of readStartDate
      (for example 00:00 to 00:30 would be the first reading in a 30 minute
      Interval)

    description: Specifies quality of reads that are not ACTUAL. For read indices
      that are not specified, quality is assumed to be ACTUAL. If not present, all
      quality of all reads are assumed to be actual. Required when interval-reads
