properties:
  deviceIdentifier:
    description: Unique identifier for a single DER device or a group of DER
      devices with the same attributes. Does not align with CDR ID permanence
      standards
    type: number
    example: 2927816
  count:
    description: Number of devices in the group of DER devices
    minimum: 1
    type: integer
    x-cds-type: PositiveInteger
    example: 3
  manufacturer:
    description: The name of the device manufacturer. If absent then assumed to be unknown
    type: string
    example: "APC"
  modelNumber:
    description: The model number of the device. If absent then assumed to be unknown

  subtype:
    description: Used to indicate the primary technology used in the DER device.
      This field is also used to record for example the battery chemistry, or
      the type of PV panel. It is also used to record if a battery is contained
      in an electric vehicle connected in a vehicle-to-grid arrangement. If
      absent then assumed to be other.
    type: string
    example: "OTHER"

    type: number
    example: 50
  nominalStorageCapacity:
    description: Maximum storage capacity in kVAh. This refers to the capacity
      of each storage module within the device group. Mandatory if type is equal
      to `STORAGE`. Default is 0 if value not known
    type: number
    example: 25
